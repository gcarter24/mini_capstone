# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# product = Product.new({ name: "desk", price: 350, image_url: "", description: "an piece of furniture you use to get work done" })
# product.save

# Product.create({ name: "bulb", price: 3, image_url: "", description: "a thing to light stuff" })

# Supplier.create(name: "Amazon", email: "jeffbezos@amazon.com", phone_number: "888-666-3782")
